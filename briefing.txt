Primary Goal

Sell directly:
	•	PeakPowerApp – 10-Week Weight Loss Program
	•	Price: €30/month

	•	Leads will be closed via DM or strategy call

The landing page must guide users naturally toward the right offer based on their readiness.

2. PRODUCT & ECOSYSTEM CLARITY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

PEAK Method (Mother Framework)

PEAK Method is the overarching personal optimization philosophy.

PEAK =
	•	P – Purpose
	•	E – Evaluation
	•	A – Action
	•	K – Knowledge

It applies to Body, Life and Money.

PeakBody

PeakBody is the Body pillar of the PEAK Method.

It is not a fitness app.
It is a mentor-led body optimization system with a biohacking-inspired approach.

4. CORE POSITIONING (ONE-LINER)

PeakBody is a 6-month body optimization system for high-performing women 30+ that combines smart training, nutrition awareness, stress regulation and blood analysis to help you look fit, feel regulated and perform at your best — without burning out your body.

This positioning must guide all copy decisions.

⸻

5. TARGET AUDIENCE

High-performing women 30+ who:
	•	Are professionals, leaders, entrepreneurs or mothers
	•	Are expected to be:
	•	productive
	•	fit
	•	emotionally stable
	•	available for everyone
	•	Are intelligent, driven and self-aware
	•	Feel chronic pressure and internal exhaustion

They do not need motivation.
They need a smarter system.

⸻

6. CORE PROBLEM (PRIMARY PAIN)

They want to look fit but:
	•	Live in chronic stress
	•	Experience hormonal imbalance symptoms:
	•	poor sleep
	•	low energy
	•	mood swings
	•	cortisol dysregulation
	•	emotional eating
	•	cycle irregularities

They have tried:
	•	diets
	•	workouts
	•	generic programs

These approaches failed because they ignored the nervous system and real life.

⸻

7. PROMISED TRANSFORMATION
	•	After 8 weeks: noticeable habit shift, better energy & regulation
	•	After 10 weeks: visible body & health improvements
	•	After 6 months: compounding results — they feel and function like a different person

This is not a challenge.
It is a systemic body reset.

⸻

8. DIFFERENTIATORS (WHY THIS WORKS)
	•	Built from real-life experience, not theory
	•	Tested on the founder and hundreds of women
	•	Smart training > hard training
	•	Awareness > restriction
	•	Consistency > extremes
	•	Mobility, strength, nervous system & lifestyle combined

⸻

9. WHAT THIS IS NOT (POSITIONING GUARDRAILS)
	•	Not gym culture
	•	Not diet culture
	•	Not influencer fitness
	•	Not “eat less, move more”
	•	Not generic programs

Avoid these narratives entirely.
