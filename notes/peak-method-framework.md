# PEAK Method Framework — Elena's Notes

## Core Philosophy: GROWTH

To grow you need to either:
- **A) Experience a change** (natural/external) — becoming adult, getting a job, moving. Not 100% controllable → growing naturally
- **B) Make a change** (intentional) — only the "smartest, strongest, boldest" evolve. Requires patience, observation, learning, adapting → growing intentionally

## Types of Natural Growth
- **Physical** → pain, skin marks, aging, hunger, sleep, tiredness → stronger, taller, defined
- **Mental** → experience, traumas, learning, anger, sadness, joy, fear, pain → more intelligent
- **Spiritual** → questioning life, discomfort, depression, anxiety, confusion → wisdom = purpose, calm, awareness

## Intentional Growth Model
Central concept: **Growth** is driven by 4 forces:
1. **Strategy & Discipline**
2. **Self Awareness**
3. **Relationships & Environment**
4. **Purpose** — to discover your purpose you need to grow in all areas

### Three Pillars of Intentional Growth:
- **Relationship** → we want to be happy, loved & accepted, emotionally mature → *you need to know yourself first*
- **Physical (Body)** → we want a healthy and sexy body, look younger and attractive → *you need to know your body*
- **Economic (Money)** → we want financial commodity, to be rich and not worry → *you need to know your finances*

## The Law of Intentionality
"Growth just doesn't happen — you must become intentional"

### 6 Misconceptions (Growth Gaps):
- **A) Assumption Gap** — "I will automatically grow" → Look for improvement
- **B) Knowledge Gap** — "I don't know how to grow" → Be clear of what you want and make a plan
- **C) Timing Gap** — "It is not the right time to begin" → Just start, the longer you wait, the difficult you find to start
- **D) Mistake Gap** — "I am afraid of making mistakes" → Learning from mistakes is easier and faster to develop potential
- **E) Perfection Gap** — "I have to find the best way" → Get started then improve
- **F) Inspiration Gap** — "I don't feel like doing it" → Discipline and motivation "why"

## PURPOSE
Your passion and dreams point your destiny, but to reach them, you need to be honest with yourself, set your goals and make a plan with a feasible strategy.

## BEING HONEST
1. Starts with living by your personal values → then, to know your WHY
- Your values are the beliefs and behaviours that give you a sense of meaning and satisfaction
- What's right for one person may not be for someone else

### Social Contagion
"We tend to copy or to adopt the ideas, behaviour or actions from the people around us!"
→ Be aware of **SOCIAL CONTAGION**

### How to separate own beliefs/desires/goals from social contagion?
**3 Key Questions:**
1. Do **I** want that? → or your family, friends?
2. Do I **WANT** that? → or desire, a hate, or like?
3. Do I want **THAT**? → or something else?

## Page 10: MONEY RELATIONSHIP & EVALUATION

### Money Mindset:
- Money is an energy, a tool — needs movement
- If you aren't lucky or come from a wealthy family, you need STRATEGY

### Rethink Your Purpose (Self-Assessment):
- I am... / I want... / My body... / My health... / My wealth... / My relationships...

### Define 2-Month Goals: MIND/LIFE | BODY | MONEY

### Evaluation Philosophy:
- Nobody is born knowing everything. To progress you need to keep learning.
- To learn: observe → try → correct/improve
- By learning you need to change. By changing you need to grow.
- To grow: develop → ask for help

### The Law of Awareness:
- Know yourself: strengths, weaknesses, interests, opportunities
- Accept who you are
- Know where you are and where you are going
- Know your unique abilities and aspirations
- Path: First awareness → acceptance → improvement → success

## Page 11: REFLECT & KNOW YOURSELF

### Self-Reflection Grid:
- How do you feel in general right now?
- What causes stress/frustration? Internal or external?
- What causes comfort/discomfort?
- How is your daily routine vs. ideal routine?
- Current financial situation → desired → what to do?

### SWOT Analysis for Personal Growth:
- Strengths | Weaknesses | Opportunities | Threats

### The Law of Expansion:
- No limit to a person's potential
- Increase capacity by including others
- Focus on learning, growing, increasing capacities

### STOP / START:
STOP: thinking about more work, "can I?", one door, doing what's expected
START: thinking "what works?", "how can I?", many doors, doing more than expected

### Push Yourself Questions:
- Do you like what you're doing now?
- What would you like to do? Can you do it?
- Do you know why you want to do it?
- Do you know what to do? Do you know people who do it?

## Page 12: HABITS & EMOTIONAL AGILITY

### Habits:
- Takes 21 days to build a habit
- "We are what we do, not what we say we will do"
- To get rid of bad habits: know the craving, replace with good one
- Track habits across: Mind | Body | Money

### Identity Exercise: Who I Am Now → Who I Want to Be → What I Need

### Anxiety & Fear Tool — Emotional Agility:
1. **Show up** to good and bad emotions to learn (envy is stronger motivator than admiration)
2. **Label your emotions** — use words to define them (stress+anger vs stress+sadness vs stress+anxiety = different)
3. **Step out** of emotions, see big picture — become more mindful, broader perspectives
4. **Describe scenarios & take action** — How I feel/Why | What's the worst | What can I do | Who can help

### Mindfulness Practice:
- Breathing in/out 4 sec
- Focus on object details
- Concentrate on automatic daily activity steps
- Listen to every detail of a song

### Body Tracking:
**Facts (before/after):** KG, size, body fat, sleep hrs, kcal, water qty
**Habits (before/after):** Morning routine, sleeping, workout, eating, skin care
**Learnings:** What food is bad? Best times for training/sleeping/eating? Best weight/size? Best training type?

### Money — Decision Taking:

## Page 15: BUDGETING

### Budgeting Rules:
1. Check account balance 2x/week
2. Don't make buying expensive things a habit
3. Automate savings

### Pyramid of Bank Accounts:
1. Check account for daily expenses (liquid)
2. Emergency fund (semi-liquid)
3. Longer-term investment

### Budgeting Formula:
1. Gross income - taxes = net income
2. Expenditure list: fix + flex
3. Net income - fix cost = financial flexibility
4. Pay yourself (savings + investment) = flex cost = budget

### Healthy Budget Rule:
- 50% net income → fix costs
- 30% → short & long term investments (defines future lifestyle)
- 20% → flex costs and lifestyle
